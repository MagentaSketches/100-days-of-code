# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: Friday, June 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 

Began the Unity Junior Programmer track. Did set up to get started - updated Unity, downloaded assets, etc. Began unit 1 'Pedal to the Metal'

**Thoughts** 

Supposed to be a 12 week program. Hoping to stay focused and finish it. It is self-paced.

### Day 2: Satursday, June 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Continued with unit 1 Lesson 1.2

**Thoughts**
Wished I had finished up this lesson because I could have but only did half. 

### Day 3: Sunday, June 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Lesson 1.3 - High Speed chase - added variables, positioned camera to follow vehicle

**Thoughts**
May time how long it takes to do the next one. It says 50 minutes but I feel like it is less time but that could be because I am enjoying it and not noticing the time passing.

### Day 4: Monday, June 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Lesson 1.4 - finished up High Speed Chase project by adding input from user to allow a player to control the driving of the vehicle.

**Thoughts**
Feel like I have learned a great deal and how to find information in the future and how Unity works.
