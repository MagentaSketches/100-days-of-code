# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: Friday, June 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 

Began the Unity Junior Programmer track. Did set up to get started - updated Unity, downloaded assets, etc. Began unit 1 'Pedal to the Metal'

**Thoughts** 

Supposed to be a 12 week program. Hoping to stay focused and finish it. It is self-paced.

### Day 2: Satursday, June 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Continued with unit 1 Lesson 1.2

**Thoughts**
Wished I had finished up this lesson because I could have but only did half. 

### Day 3: Sunday, June 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Lesson 1.3 - High Speed chase - added variables, positioned camera to follow vehicle

**Thoughts**
May time how long it takes to do the next one. It says 50 minutes but I feel like it is less time but that could be because I am enjoying it and not noticing the time passing.

### Day 4: Monday, June 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Lesson 1.4 - finished up High Speed Chase project by adding input from user to allow a player to control the driving of the vehicle.

**Thoughts**
Feel like I have learned a great deal and how to find information in the future and how Unity works.

### Day 5: Tuesday, June 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Challenge 1 - Plane Programming - finished the challenge and bonus challenge. Included fixing bugs, adding functionality and creating new script to make propeller spin.

**Thoughts**

I didn't Google once to complete any of it. I used documentation and did refer to first prototype for help.

### Day 6: Wednesday June 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Set up design document for personal project

**Thoughts**
Design doc is rough draft and may add to the backlog as I think of more features not part of the MVP

### Day 7: Thursday June 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Worked through bonus features adding more crates and enemy vehicles. Tomorrow to work on hard mode - switching cameras and multiplayer

**Thoughts**

Need to research multiplayer and camera. I've added second camera and now to map a key to switch views

### Day 8 : Friday June 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
got the second camera added where you can toggle between the two cameras. Had to Google and actually found the solution in the Unity documentation.



**Thoughts**

Will tackle the last challenge multiplayer in two days. Plan to work on personal project for the weekend

### Day 9 : Saturday, June 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
started personal project. Got POC scene built. now to find an object to represent paper or create one and start coding. Also cleaned up the hard task of the multiplayer challenge. Just need to record demo and share.

**Thoughts**

Feeling more confident with Unity and actually enjoying it. 

### Day 10: Sunday, June 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
got the camera to follow player. the asset I got already had a script to move the character and it had one to follow target but opted to write my own for practice and to have something that I would understand.

**Thoughts**

Happy with progress so far. Interesting working with other assets and scripts. 

### Day 11: Monday, June 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Started second unit and finished Gameplay that basically set up next game with objects, make the player move and set boundaries so they don't leave the playing area.

**Thoughts**
Retaining some of what I learned from previous unit and this one is building on that knowledge and reinforcing it.
