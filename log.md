# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 9, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I feel like I am the most seasoned beginner. I am doing the 100 days of code to hone my skills and to be more confident with coding. Most days I will be watching videos, doing Free Code Camp. Today I watched some class on Javascript on SkillShare and did a very simple Hello World web page.

**Thoughts** I plan to do most of my learning before work since at the end of the day my brain is fried.

1. Nothing that exciting and since I only get 10 shares a month on code pen will wait until it's something worth seeing. Just imaging the word "Hello!" in colors of the rainbow with the different header tags with a little CSS for the color.
